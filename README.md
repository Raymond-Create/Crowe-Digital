Goodday!!!

I m working on a project of creating a collaborative tool that can be licensed and patent providing royalities as revenue. 

(i) No need of coding
(ii) The idea is creation of structures and workloads that provide financial rewards to an organisation
(iii) The project requires attetion as there will be automated time sheets, requests and approvals. There is need for a quick turnaound.

Those that are interested drop me an email: raymond.sibanda@crowe.co.zw

Let the games begin
